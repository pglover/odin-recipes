    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tomato Egg is a really common Chinese dish, however everyone makes it different. The more common recipes look
        more like stir fried tomatoes with big chunks of scrambled eggs. The way my parents make tomato egg is more
        Cantonese style and leans heavily into gravy territory - just the way I like it! Nothing wrong with the drier,
        scrambled egg style, but there’s just something appealing about gravy and rice!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1” knob ginger, cut into thin matchsticks</li>
        <li>4 cups (about 5) roma tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp crushed red chili flakes</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>1/3 cup green onions, chopped, reserve some for garnish</li>
        <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ginger and cook until fragrant and just starting to
            brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, salt, white pepper, crushed red chili flakes, sesame oil, and oyster
            sauce. Toss to combine and continue to cook until the tomatoes are jammy, stirring occasionally, 5 to 8
            minutes.</li>

        <li>In a small bowl, whisk to combine water and cornstarch for the slurry. Pour the slurry into the pan and
            stir. Allow the tomatoes to continue cooking until broken down and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to
            maintain a simmer.</li>

        <li>Drizzle the eggs over the tomatoes and do not stir. Let the eggs gently cook in the tomatoes until just
            barely set, 2 minutes. Add the green onions and then gently stir to break up the egg. Don’t stir too much!
        </li>

        <li>Serve the tomato egg with steamed rice and garnish with chopped green onions.</li>
    </ol>
