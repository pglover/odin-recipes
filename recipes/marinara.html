    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Healthy, delicious, sugar-free tomato sauce is hard to come by in a jar or can. Most often it contains
        ingredients I don't want in my body, like sugar. For those with gluten sensitivities, buying store bought of any
        product can be challenging. Most jarred tomato sauces are gluten free, but isn't it better to be able to be in
        control of what goes into your body by simply making your own?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or avocado oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>56 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon fennel seed crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>red chili pepper flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or pot. Sauté the garlic just until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once at a boil, cover and reduce heat. Simmer for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir, taste and adjust seasonings. Makes about 8 cups.</li>
        <li>Use immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
